> **AI character platform for interactive applications**

A secure, production-ready system for creating AI-powered interactive characters that bring digital personalities to life, with real-time voice interaction, built with modern ML frameworks and enterprise-grade security.

## ‚ú® What It Does

**Core Functionality:**
- **Real-time voice interaction** with speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- **AI character personalities** with conversational memory
- **Voice cloning** for custom character voices
- **Multi-language support** with cultural adaptation
- **Child-safe content filtering** and parental controls

**System Design:**
```
Audio Input ‚Üí Wav2Vec2 (STT) ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí Coqui TTS (TTS + Voice Cloning) ‚Üí Audio Output
```

**Architecture:**
- **Secure PyTorch 2.8.0+** with all security vulnerabilities patched
- **Wav2Vec2** for speech recognition
- **Coqui TTS** for speech synthesis and voice cloning
- **Edge-optimized** for low-latency real-time interaction
- **Production-ready** with monitoring, logging, and security scanning

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/parrenthesis/character-ai.git
cd character-ai

# Set up development environment
make setup-dev

# Run tests to verify installation
make test
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Run tests (117 tests)
make test

# Run linting and formatting
make lint

# Run security checks
make security

# Build and test Docker images locally
make docker-build    # Builds development image
make docker-test     # Runs tests in Docker environment
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

**Secure ML Pipeline:**
```
Audio Input ‚Üí Wav2Vec2 (STT) ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí Coqui TTS (TTS + Voice Cloning) ‚Üí Audio Output
```

**System Components:**
- **Web Layer**: FastAPI, WebSocket, REST API, Authentication
- **Core Layer**: Character Management, Voice Engine, LLM Integration, Safety
- **ML Layer**: Wav2Vec2 (STT), Coqui TTS (TTS + Voice Cloning), Secure PyTorch 2.8.0+
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Security Scanning

**Why This Architecture:**
- **Separate ML models image**: Pre-downloads large ML models (Wav2Vec2, Coqui TTS) to avoid download delays at runtime
- **Secure PyTorch 2.8.0+**: Patches all critical security vulnerabilities
- **Wav2Vec2 + Coqui TTS**: Secure, unified voice pipeline
- **Edge-optimized**: Designed for low-latency real-time interaction on edge devices

### Deployment Options

#### üê≥ **Docker Development**
```bash
# Build and run locally for development
make docker-build
make docker-run

# Or use docker-compose for full stack
make docker-compose-up

# Run tests in Docker
make docker-test

# Clean up Docker resources
make docker-clean
```

#### üè≠ **Production Deployment**
```bash
# Build models bundle (downloads ML models)
make bundle

# Build production Docker images
make models-image    # Contains pre-downloaded ML models
make runtime-image   # Contains the application runtime

# Deploy with Docker Compose (includes monitoring)
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f character-ai

# Access monitoring
# Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
# Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
```

#### ‚ò∏Ô∏è **Kubernetes Deployment**
```bash
# Apply Kubernetes manifests
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Check deployment status
kubectl get pods -l app=character-ai

# Access services
kubectl port-forward svc/character-ai 8000:8000
```

#### üñ•Ô∏è **Bare Metal Deployment**
```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.10 nginx redis-server

# Deploy application
poetry install --no-dev
sudo systemctl start cai
```

## üß™ Testing

The platform includes comprehensive testing:

```bash
# Run all tests (117 tests)
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run tests in Docker
make docker-test

# Run security checks
make security
```

**Test Status:**
- ‚úÖ **117 tests passing** (100% pass rate)
- ‚úÖ **0 security vulnerabilities** (Bandit, Safety, Detect-secrets)
- ‚úÖ **All linting clean** (Ruff, Black, Isort, MyPy)
- ‚úÖ **Secure architecture** (PyTorch 2.8.0+, Wav2Vec2, Coqui TTS)

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Works out of the box** - only set these for custom behavior:

```bash
# OPTIONAL: Override defaults
export CAI_DEBUG="true"                    # Enable debug mode
export CAI_API__HOST="0.0.0.0"           # Allow external connections
export CAI_GPU__DEVICE="cpu"              # Force CPU usage

# OPTIONAL: Authentication (uses empty string by default)
export CAI_JWT_SECRET="your-secret-here"  # Only needed for auth endpoints

# OPTIONAL: Cloud LLM providers (falls back to local if not set)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

### Character Configuration

Characters are configured via YAML files in `configs/characters/`:

```yaml
# configs/characters/data/profile.yaml
name: "Data" # From Star Trek: The Next Generation
personality: "Logical, curious, helpful"
voice: "calm, measured"
language: "en"
safety_level: "child_safe"
